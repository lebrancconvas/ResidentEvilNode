If your guess matches the random number of the enemy -- your character inflicts a random amount of damage between 1 and 5.
If your guess does not match the random number of the enemy -- they will inflict a random amount of damage to your character between 1 and 5.  Each round the enemy is given a new random number and you must guess again.
